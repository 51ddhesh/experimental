### Comparison between linear search and binary search

- Range of elements:  -5000000 to 5000000 
- Size of array: 10000 to 5000000

Tried out multithreading with linear search.<br>
The time taken by multithreaded linear search is slower possibly due to thread creation overhead and thread joining.
